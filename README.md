# Park Now

A native application that helps you find the nearest road-side parking spots.

The app allows you to see empty road-side parking spots left by other users on the map and automatically searches the closest one in your vicinity. All you have to do is to tap on 2 buttons, one to search for the closest spot, the other to show others that you occupy the spot. In addition, once you marked your location when parked, if you choose to leave your contact, and say there are some unexpected situations that happened to your car such as a break in, other users of the app have the ability to quickly notify you about the situation. Since your parked location is marked you also never have to worry about not being able to find your car. Once you decide to leave, just tap on the same button as you tapped for occupying the spot, and your old spot will be up for grabs. To top it all off, we calculate the amount of carbon you have prevented from emitting and the amount of time you have saved to show that you are doing a good thing for both yourself and the world.
